# athena-query

Command line utility for querying AWS Athena, seeks to emulate sqlite3.  It implements some similar commands (the . notation) as sqlite3.

It provides an interactive shell where you can run SQL queries against AWS Athena.  The utility sends the query to Athena and then displays the results as a table or as CSV.
